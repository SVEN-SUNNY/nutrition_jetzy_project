NutriJet is an AI-powered nutrition planner that creates personalized meal plans by combining machine learning with rule-based recommendations. At its core, a Gradient Boosting model analyzes user inputs like dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, keto) and health goals (weight loss, muscle gain), trained on a mix of synthetic data and real user selections to predict the most suitable meal plans. When the ML model encounters edge cases—like new diet trends, it falls back to a curated rule-based system (e.g., "if diabetic, prioritize low-carb options"). The system generates breakfast/lunch/dinner suggestions with detailed nutrition breakdowns, showing both meal-specific macros and daily totals. Hosted on Render (backend) and Netlify (frontend), NutriJet improves over time by retraining its model daily with new user feedback, ensuring recommendations stay relevant and accurate. Every time you pick a plan, you're not just getting a diet—you're helping the AI learn to serve better suggestions for everyone.
